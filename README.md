# 🧠 Stroke Risk Prediction App

This Streamlit application predicts the risk of **stroke (AVC)** based on 5 key clinical variables using a logistic regression model.

## 📊 Objective

This project aims to demonstrate the potential of **data science and machine learning** for public health prevention. It is part of a research-oriented academic project to support early detection and decision-making in healthcare.

## 🎯 Features

- Prediction based on 5 variables:  
  `age`, `hypertension`, `heart_disease`, `avg_glucose_level`, `bmi`
- Logistic Regression model (AUC ≈ 0.83)
- Live risk simulation via a simple user interface (Streamlit)
- Real-time risk interpretation and recommendations
- Lightweight, fast, and interpretable
